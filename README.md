# RECIPIE-RECOMMENDATION-ASSINGMENT
**Detailed Project Description – Recipe Recommendation Assignment**

This project focuses on building a foundational understanding of recipe recommendation systems through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **feature extraction**. Similar to popular recipe websites like [food.com](https://www.food.com/recipe/chilaquiles-with-chicken-67921), which offer sections like “You’ll also love,” the objective is to analyze patterns in recipe data and user interactions to eventually recommend similar or relevant recipes based on past behavior, preferences, or recipe characteristics.

The goal is to work with a **large-scale dataset** that requires distributed processing. For this, you'll be using **Apache Spark on Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)**, a cloud-based big data processing service. This infrastructure allows efficient analysis of large datasets that would otherwise be difficult to handle on local systems.

### Key Deliverables:
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and feature extraction on raw recipe data.
- Use Spark to extract features such as recipe ingredients, cuisines, ratings, and user preferences.
- Identify meaningful patterns that can serve as the foundation for a future recommendation engine.
- Use cluster computing to improve processing time and performance.

### Tech Stack:
- **Apache Spark** for distributed data handling and processing.
- **AWS EMR** (recommended setup: 1 master node - `m4.xlarge`, 1 core node - `m4.large`) for managing the Spark cluster.
- Jupyter or Zeppelin notebooks (optional) for visual exploration.

### Learning Outcome:
Through this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience working with large datasets in a distributed environment, developing scalable data pipelines with Spark, and understanding the principles that power modern recommendation systems used on e-commerce and content platforms.
